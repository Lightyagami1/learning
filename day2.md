# DAY 2 : Socket Programming

## Thread vs Process
1. Interthread communication is easier compared to process (same resource pool)
2. Resouce sharing 

## Java virtual machine
* interpreted
* platform independent

## Interprocess comm.
* shared memory
* socket (message passing)
* pipes

### Socket is software representation of NIC.

## http protocol : port 80
* get
* post
* fetch
* delete

## HTML is document, not a program :P

## angular is clent side service

## REST api 
return only data back to server

## Multi threading 
+ just focus on critcal section


# Lock is owned by object in java, thread inherit it from object

* yeild() function of java is for thread fairness, or it can be used to pass over the resources.
* Thread have priority from 1 to 10
